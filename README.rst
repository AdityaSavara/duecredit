========

pubtrace is conceived to address the problem of inadequate citation of
scientific software and methods.

It provides a simple framework (at the moment for Python only) to embed
references in the original code so they would be automatically collected
and reported to the user.  Only references for actually used portions will be
presented back.

No need for prima ballerina projects
------------------------------------

Scientific software is developed often to gain citations for original
publication through the use of the software implementing it.  Unfortunately
such established procedure discourages new implementations to the existing
projects.  With easy ways to provide only relevant 

Core libraries adequately referenced
